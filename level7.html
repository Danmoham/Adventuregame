    <h2> "Thank you for giving my pet Wolf the Bone you recieved, it is really appreciated. I will give you a 50% temporary power boost as a thank you for this kind gesture. As for your abduction,
        there is an evil Demon who lurks in a mansion in the south named Cozuzu. This is who the witch may have been referring too! He has a full army of Demons and is trying to ruin this small island!
        There are very few good souls left on this island, but the more people he finds and lets die the stronger he will get! I do not dare to challenge him as I currently am at peace, but
        if you carry on going south you will find him, but beware he is very powerful and very difficult to defeat! Good luck on your journey!
