# Adventuregame

This is a little adventure game I have done on with the console to help me understand classes more in depth and to give me a little bit of experience with HTML and CSS before I start my journey at Northcoders, please feel free to download all the files and give it a try! Please also give me any tips or anyways I can improve my code :). Please use a code editor when running this and make sure all the files are in the same folder. I recommend running this on node with at least V14, Please run the command node AdventureGame.js. After each tab opens you will have to manually close the tab down to proceed with the next section of the game.
