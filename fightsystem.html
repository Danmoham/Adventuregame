    <h1> HOW THE FIGHT SYSTEM WORKS!</h1>
    <br> <!-- Line break -->
    <h2>Within the game, you will encounter many battles, however every battle follows the same principal. You will have three attacks when approaching a new opponent, A light attack which only does 80% damage,
        A speed attack which performs 120% damage and a power attack which performs 130% damage. The speed and power attacks are dependent on your stats compared to the opponents stats, so please check
        this before using the attack as you may be punished for any mistakes! Please note this is only used once at the start of the fight, after that the second hit is randomised and from there you take turns
        using only regular power stats so it is crucial to start the fight well!
